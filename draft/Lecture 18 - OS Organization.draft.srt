0,240 240,300 300,510 510,720 720,1020
first a little bit of

0,630 840,1350 1350,1590 1590,1950 1950,2010

0,120 120,360 360,450 450,780 780,1290

0,510 510,690 690,1020 1020,1620 1650,1830

0,540
take

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,450

0,450 450,750 750,1140 1140,1740 1770,2220

0,270 270,450 450,480 480,780 780,900

0,300 300,990 990,1410 1410,1470 1470,1830
can't necessarily expect a single

0,330 330,510 510,810 1920,2130 2130,2370
answers might be.| So first

53
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,240
0,60 60,540 570,930 930,990 990,1170
of all, let me try

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,540
0,300 300,1410 1440,1860 1860,2370 2400,3300
to crystallize what the traditional

55
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
0,960 960,1650 2400,2850 2850,3000 3000,3060

0,360 360,1170 1200,1290 1290,1410 1410,1470
kernel interfaces we ought to

57
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,860
0,120 120,480 690,1350 1380,2430 2430,2790
be using| and Linux and

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,030
0,510 510,630 630,780 780,930 930,1170

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,400
0,150 150,270 270,780 780,930
are all examples of,

60
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,130
0,420 1290,1590 1590,1710 1710,2220 2220,2730
of what I personally call

61
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,740
0,420 600,1230 1230,1590 1590,2220 2250,2550
a traditional design approach,| but

62
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,390
0,450 450,780 780,960 960,1080 1080,1230
another word for it, that

63
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,160
0,150 150,240 240,1230 1620,2160
kind of summarizes {},|

64
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,090
0,150 150,300 300,570 570,690 690,930
but this approach has ended

65
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,160
0,150 150,360 360,750 750,1650
up like is monolithic.|

0,270 270,510 510,660 660,990 990,1140
{} what that means is

69
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,470
0,330 360,600 600,1110 1110,1320 1320,1410
that the kernel is a

70
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,390
0,390 390,990 990,1500 1500,1620 1620,1920

all kinds of things, all

72
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,260
0,270 270,330 330,600 600,1140

0,330 510,1110 1110,1350 1350,1590 1590,2370
And indeed this really reflects

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,980
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,810 810,1140

0,180 180,540 1260,1830 1830,1920 1920,2130
that the way to get

0,180 180,240 240,360 360,960 1620,2190
has to be fast,| however

1491
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,200
0,480 480,600 600,960 960,1320
now we're starting to

1492
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,960
0,540 990,1410
{ -}

1493

0,480 480,720 720,840 840,1320 1320,1740
talk about a serious potential

0,210 210,450 450,540 540,630 630,870
So first let me show

1498
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,710
0,360 360,960 1650,2100 2100,2820 2820,3120
you {} a straightforward, but

1499
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,880
0,240 240,570 570,1440
very slow design,|

1500
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,000
0,810 1440,2190 2190,2580 2580,2790 2790,3120
for IPC patterned off of

1501
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,860
0,390 390,1020 1020,1200 1200,1260 1260,1470
Unix pipes| and I'm bringing

1502
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,480
0,150 150,330 330,810 840,1290 1290,1620
this up because some early

1503
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,400
0,270 270,840
micro kernels

1504
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,290
0,480 660,1290 1290,1440 1440,1680 1680,1740
{} worked in sort of

1505
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,190
0,150 150,510 510,660 660,750 750,900
a similar way to what

1506
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,030
0,60 60,330 330,420 420,630 630,840
I'm about to show you,|

1507
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,870
0,300 300,510 510,630 630,690 690,780
which turned out to be

1508
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,360
0,420 1560,1800 1800,2190 2310,2910
slow.| Okay, so, {}

1509
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,670
0,360 360,780 780,930 930,1860 1890,2610
let's suppose you have, {}

1510
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,050
0,120 120,210 210,360 360,660 690,840
you know you have two

1511
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,760
0,570 570,660 660,840 840,1080 1080,1710

1512
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,890
0,750 750,1080 1080,1410 1410,1590 1590,1770
{P1 -} wants to send

1513
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,440
0,60 60,360 360,480 480,960

1514
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,620
0,540

1515
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,640
0,300 300,480 480,660 660,810 810,930
{} So how should that

1516
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,830
0,240 240,570 600,870 900,1320 1320,2190
actually work,| well, one possibility

1517
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,510
0,180 180,300 300,720 750,960 960,1680
is to have a send

1518
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,100
0,450 450,1020
system call,|

1519
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,400
0,240 240,360 360,510 510,840 840,1080
and you give send system

1520
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,960
0,240 240,390 390,1170 1170,1260 1260,1560
call the id of the

1521
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,500
0,180 180,570 570,660 660,810 810,870
{} thread you want to

1522
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,970
0,180 180,210 210,570 570,960 960,1470
send a message to| and

1523
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,520
0,690 720,1830
a pointer

1524
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,050
0,300 300,420 420,1230 1230,1380 1380,1530
to the message to the

1525
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,910
0,540 540,690 690,900 1560,1710 1710,1860
bytes, may be that you

1526
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:58,690
0,270 270,420 420,480 480,720 720,780
actually want to send to

1527
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,340
0,180 180,630 630,870 930,1230 1230,1650
that process,| so this system

1528
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,150
0,330 330,360 360,480 480,540 540,810
call are going to jump

1529
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,460

0,210 210,330 330,810 810,1080 1080,1470
maybe we design this patterned

1531
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,670
0,900 930,1320 1320,1410 1410,1620 1620,1740

0,210 210,450 450,630 630,1020 1230,1530

0,90 90,150 150,540 540,660 660,960

somebody else's request,| so it's

1538
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:17,560

1544
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,840
0,180 180,810
call send,

1549
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,100
0,150 150,360 360,1200 1320,1740 1740,2040
in these systems you rarely

1550
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,970
0,270 270,510 510,570 570,810 810,870

remote procedure call operation,| so

1555
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,490
0,210 210,600 600,810 810,930 930,1080

0,270 270,390 390,750 750,1080 1290,1800
moment,| so send would append

0,510 510,570 570,870 870,1350 1410,1710

0,600 660,1020 1020,1230 1230,1590 1590,1620

0,120 120,660 660,960 960,1380 1380,2130
it's called a buffered system,

0,1290 1590,1770 1770,2280 2310,2610 2610,3090

0,60 60,450 450,540 540,660 660,1230
the send| and then later

1600
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,190
0,240 240,330 330,660 660,1050 1050,1140
when the receive happens it

1601
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,150
0,360 360,450 450,750 750,900 900,960

0,120 120,270 270,600 660,1320 1320,1830

2473

0,240 240,300 300,450 450,570 570,690

01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,800
0,840 960,2100
about virtual,

2764

0,210 210,450 450,510 510,780 780,990

2765
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,330
0,90 90,480 480,690 690,810 810,1380

0,600 960,1230 1230,1350 1350,1590 1590,1800

0,120 120,300 300,720 1050,1320 1320,2190

2769
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:04,860
0,180 180,390 390,720 720,810 810,1110

2770
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:07,040
0,90 90,480 510,1170 1200,1680

0,210 210,360 360,660 660,1230 1260,1770

0,150 150,390 390,690 690,870 870,990

2956
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:23,590
0,150 150,330 330,750 750,1260 1530,2400
We're gonna ask, {} why,

2957
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:25,990
0,750 810,990 990,1350 1350,1620 1620,2400
{ -} it seems like

2958
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,910
0,420 420,690 690,1140 1140,1260 1260,1530
some some tasks are more

2959
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,920
0,660 660,780 780,1260 1290,1560 1560,2010
appropriate to be put outside

2960
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,690
0,90 90,480 480,660 660,1260 1350,1770
the kernel than others,| but

2961
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:33,640
0,420 450,1020 1020,1440 1440,1560 1560,1950
this L4 like the approach

2962
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,080
0,120 120,450 450,840 840,1170 1170,1440
with micro kernels always seems

2963
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,370
0,90 90,240 240,630 630,1170 1170,1290
to be either everything or

2964
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:38,290
0,540 570,930 930,1500 1530,1770 1770,1920
nothing,| like either you have

2965
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:40,300
0,90 90,750 750,1080 1080,1440 1440,2010
a monolithic kernel doing everything

2966
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,460
0,390 420,1050 1050,1290 1290,1590 1800,2160
or nothing,| just like I

2967
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,350
0,120 120,420 420,1170 1170,1650 1650,1890
feel like paging and some

2968
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:45,640
0,240 240,690 690,900 900,1050 1050,1290
other things could be very

2969
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,170
0,480 480,840 840,960 960,1380 1380,1530
efficient inside the kernel,| and

2970
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:48,970
0,360 420,750 750,960 960,1260 1260,1800
then maybe like file systems

2971
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:50,080
0,360 360,630 630,810 810,1020 1020,1110
that things that need to

2972
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,160
0,150 150,510 510,780 780,960 960,1080
be {swappable -} could be

2973
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,590
0,690 1260,1590 1590,1770 1770,1890 1890,2430
outside,| {} and then even

2974
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,760
0,300 300,480 480,630 630,900 900,1080
like you can maybe even

2975
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,870
0,240 240,330 330,660 660,840 840,1110
have a kernel that has

2976
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:57,250
0,150 150,870 870,1020 1020,1200 1200,1380
some functionality,| but you can

2977
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,960
0,630 630,870 870,1230 1230,1500 1500,1710
opt to not use it

2978
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,280
0,150 150,510 510,720 720,1020
and provide your own,|

2979
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,430
0,150 150,330 330,810 1380,1740 1740,1890
is there any thing.| You

2980
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:05,310
0,270 270,480 480,1710 2040,2400 2400,2880
say is absolutely, well taken

2981
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:07,290
0,330 510,1170 1170,1260 1260,1590 1710,1980
and indeed there were a

2982
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,520
0,270 270,330 330,720 720,1140 1140,1230
lot of micro kernel or

2983
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,580
0,300 300,630 630,990 990,1920 2610,3060
micro kernel related projects| and

2984
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,930
0,300 300,390 390,690 690,1080 1080,1350
many of them built various

2985
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:15,180
0,210 210,270 270,1020 1260,2100 2100,2250
kinds of hybrids,| like there's

2986
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:16,260
0,240 240,270 270,540 540,780 780,1080
actually a couple different versions

2987
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,220
0,120 120,480 480,630 630,840 840,960
of Mach| and some of

2988
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,320
0,330
them

2989
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,810
0,120 120,270 270,330 330,780 780,1170
{} sort of hybrid kernels,|

2990
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:20,770
0,270 270,480 480,600 600,780 780,960
which yeah there was this

2991
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:21,760
0,270 270,480 480,600 600,690 690,990
micro kernel that knew about

2992
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:23,530
0,750 750,930 930,1350 1440,1650 1650,1710
IPC,| but also in the

2993
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:26,260
0,630 720,1320 1320,1410 1410,2190
kernel was a complete

2994
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,680
0,840 990,1200 1200,1590 1590,1860 1860,2040
Unix,| so {for,instance} Mach {2.5

2995
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,280
0,270 270,1050
- -}

2996
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,440
0,330 330,870 1110,1620 1620,1770 1770,2100
was this hybrid with it.|

2997
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,070
0,240 240,480 480,810 810,1200 1200,1590
But micro kernel and Unix

2998
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:35,670
0,210 210,390 390,450 450,540 540,600
all sort of in the

2999
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,470
0,480 510,1020 1320,1560 1560,1710 1710,1800
same kernel| and you can

3000
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:38,850
0,150 150,420 420,690 690,1260 1260,1380
make system calls either and

3001
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,200
0,180 180,450 450,600 600,960 960,1350
some stuff was built in,|

3002
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,270
0,240 240,450 450,600 630,1260 1260,1590
the sort of micro kernel

3003
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:43,680
0,270 270,420 420,630 630,1080 1080,1410
way,| but some things they

3004
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,910
0,90 90,270 270,570 690,870 870,1230
were just used the kernel

3005
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,380
0,120 120,270 270,450 450,990 1260,1470
that was in Mach,| that

3006
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,550
0,120 120,390 390,690 780,930 930,1170
was built into the Mach

3007
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,080
0,330 450,690 720,1110 1110,1320 1320,1530
kernel,| the Unix kernel was

3008
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,980
0,210 210,330 330,450 450,540 540,900
built into {the,Mach -} kernel,

3009
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:53,040
0,450 750,1350 1350,1800 1800,2070 2070,2760
a modern {MAC,OS -} also

3010
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:54,750
0,450 450,510 510,570 570,720 720,930
built in a way that

3011
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,160
0,270 510,660 660,780 780,870 870,1410
like the way you describe,|

3012
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,620
0,60 60,180 180,600 600,1230 1800,2460
you know Mac OS has

3013
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,020
0,90 90,450 450,750 750,1050 1050,1140
a complete operating system with

3014
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:01,950
0,60 60,330 330,570 570,660 660,930
a file system and everything

3015
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:02,970
0,360 360,480 480,600 600,720 720,1020
inside it,| but it also

3016
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:05,250
0,150 150,330 330,780 780,1170 1530,2280
has good support for IPC

3017
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,020
0,240 270,510 510,570 570,900 1170,1770
and sort of like threads,|

3018
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:07,800
0,180 180,270 270,570 570,690 690,780
all the stuff you would

3019
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,410
0,270 330,690 900,1290 1290,1980 2040,2610
want to build micro kernel

3020
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:12,660
0,780 900,1890
style services.|

3021
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,790
0,720 720,1350 1380,1770 1770,2130 2130,2220
{Is,Google's} Fuchsia, I'm aware of

3022
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:16,930
0,270 270,810 810,900 900,990 990,1140
also implements some of these

3023
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:18,820
0,360 360,570 570,690 690,1050 1560,1890
ideas now as well.| I'll

3024
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:19,940
0,270 270,570
bet yeah.|

3025
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,590
0,240 240,570 570,1020 1020,1140 1140,1410
So anyway, there's no one

3026
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:24,940
0,570
way,

3027
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:25,720
0,270 270,360 360,600 600,690 690,780
there were people who were

3028
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,920
0,210 210,300 300,840 840,1080 1110,1200
sort of hoping that a

3029
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,580
0,1080
pure,

3030
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:31,430
0,120 120,480 480,1710 2010,2610 2610,2760
a very pure scheme could

3031
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:32,940
0,120 120,330 330,420 420,930
be made to work.|

3032
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,910
0,240 240,420 420,510 510,690 690,1050
It's not the only possible

3033
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:42,620
0,150 150,600 3120,3750 3750,4200 4230,4710
way forward.| Alright, thanks, got

3034
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,690
0,210 210,690 720,1200 1200,1560 1710,2070
around my {next,lecture}, {but,I'll,see} you

3035
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:47,060
0,360 1260,1470 1470,1710
guys.| {See,you,later -}.|

3036
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,880
0,180 180,510
Thank you.|

3037
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,100
0,150 150,540
You're welcome.|

3038
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:53,750
0,390 390,660 660,900 900,1080 1080,1290
Oh I I didn't have

3039
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:54,680
0,150 210,300 300,630 630,870 870,930
a,| I have just a

3040
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,510
0,570 600,930 930,930 930,1560 1560,1830
remark, I I think it's

3041
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:59,180
0,600 600,960 1110,1500 1650,2190 2190,2670
fascinating,| that it it's like

3042
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,990
0,300 300,660 660,1020 1020,1170 1170,1290
{5% -} slower, but it

3043
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,490
0,210 210,330 330,570 570,960 990,1500
does so much more work,|

3044
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,620
0,270 270,450 450,930 930,1080 1080,1410
yeah was fascinated with that.|

3045
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:06,930
0,300 300,420 420,570 570,720 720,810
You mean that even though

3046
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:07,770
0,120 120,300 300,480 480,630 630,840
it's doing much more work

3047
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,470
0,120 120,270 270,570 570,1560 2190,2700
is only slightly slower,| really

3048
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:12,360
0,240 240,360 360,780 900,1500 1500,1890
have a really sweat blood

3049
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,960
0,240 240,540 1380,2100 2100,2850 3330,3600
over the IPC performance| and

3050
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,640
0,480 480,1020 1020,1170 1170,1230 1230,1680
it's another thing to remember,

3051
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,280
0,150 150,420 420,510 510,840
of course is that,|

3052
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:20,660
0,210 210,420 420,720 720,1200 1230,1350
if you start doing, if

3053
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,610
0,120 120,600 1050,1080 1110,1770 1770,1950
you're doing a significant amount

3054
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:24,410
0,90 90,600 630,870 870,1290 1290,1800
of work per system call,|

3055
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,940
0,120 120,390 540,1140 1140,1260 1260,1560
you know, looking at files

3056
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,950
0,90 90,900 900,990 990,1650 1710,2010
and directories or something,| then

3057
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:30,120
0,60 60,660 660,750 750,840 840,1170
the cost of the system

3058
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,860
0,270 270,360 360,840 840,1320 1320,1740
call, the IPC itself starts

3059
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,140
0,120 120,240 240,900 1140,1920
to be less important.|

3060
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:36,210
0,270 270,420 420,900 900,960 960,1320
So the combination of faster

3061
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,100
0,300 300,660 660,990 990,1230 1230,1890
system calls plus real programs

3062
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,810
0,150 150,390 390,660 660,960 1440,1710
do things other than making

3063
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:41,440
0,300 300,960
system calls.|

3064

0,300 300,420 420,570 570,840 840,1020
But you would also like

3065
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:45,740
0,960 1020,1410 1410,2010 2010,2400 2490,2970
switch page tables and.| Yeah.|

3066
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:47,930
0,420 420,1020 1440,1650 1650,1920 1920,2040
The {others,have}.| Yeah, although the

3067
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,100
0,390 390,480 480,750 750,960 960,1170
paper, I did not talk

3068
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,030
0,210 210,270 270,420 420,540 540,930
about it,| but the paper

3069
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:51,800
0,240 240,420 420,780 780,1320 1320,1770
had some clever tricks for

3070

0,540 540,660 660,1260 1260,1440 1440,1950
avoiding the cost of switching

3071
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:55,460
0,360 360,930 960,1260 1260,1350 1350,1410
page tables,| I don't know

3072
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:58,310
0,90 90,210 210,1080 2010,2280 2280,2850
if you remember for some

3073
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,720
0,180 180,600 600,870 870,1170 1170,1380
of its on page six,|

0,90 90,300 300,480 480,1500 1530,2130
we're talking about supporting tagged

0,390 390,450 450,750 750,1470 1710,2040
TLBs a small spaces,| they

0,120 120,300 300,690 690,1140 1140,1320
have some clever ideas for

0,930 930,1590 1590,2010 2010,2730
not swhich page tables,|

0,360 360,450 450,630 630,840 840,1020
which I had not heard

0,120 120,420 420,510 510,630 630,810
of before I read this

0,180 180,300 300,570 570,990 990,1230
This is pretty cool, thank

3082
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:16,020
0,90 90,270 270,840 1230,1860
you so much, bye.|
